Welcome to my new personal website! I've moved from my old site at leekandpickle.com to this new home at gtez.com.

## Why the Change?

I wanted a cleaner, more streamlined web presence that better reflects where I am in my career. As the co-founder and CEO of Critical Path Games, I wanted a platform where I could share thoughts about game development, leadership, and the industry.

Stay tuned for more posts!
